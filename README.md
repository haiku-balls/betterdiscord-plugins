Plugins i've created or reverse-engineered?

## Plugins [12/6]

EnableExperients - Enables the experiments tab within Discord's settings. *as of 12/18 this is working*

The code is based off of this [gist](https://gist.github.com/JohannesMP/afdf27383608c3b6f20a6a072d0be93c?permalink_comment_id=4370892#gistcomment-4370892). Simply changing the 'undefined variables' to consts got this working.
